    question: "How does nicotine gum work?",
    answer: "Nicotine gum works by releasing a controlled amount of nicotine into your bloodstream through the lining of your mouth. This helps reduce nicotine withdrawal symptoms and cravings while you work on breaking the habit of smoking. The gum provides nicotine without the harmful chemicals found in cigarettes."

  {
    question: "How should I use RYZE Nicotine Gum?",
    answer: "Chew the gum slowly until you notice a tingling sensation or peppery taste, then place it between your cheek and gums. When the tingling fades (about a minute), chew again until the tingling returns, then park it in a different spot. Continue this \"chew and park\" method for about 30 minutes. Do not chew continuously like regular gum as this may cause side effects like hiccups, heartburn, or nausea."

Always consult with your healthcare provider before using any nicotine replacement products during pregnancy or while breastfeeding."
